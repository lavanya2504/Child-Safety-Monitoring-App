# CHILD SAFETY MONITORING APP

This project implements a smart bicycle safety system using Android devices to monitor a child's safety during cycling activities. The system leverages embedded hardware sensors (gyroscope, accelerometer, GPS, microphone, antenna) in conjunction with mobile devices to provide real-time monitoring and alerts to parents.

# Objective of the app

Real-time Monitoring:

  Continuously monitors GPS, accelerometer, and gyroscope data to detect:
  Overspeeding
  Fall detection (minimizing false positives)
  Boundary crossing (geofencing)
  
Alerts and Notifications:

  Alerts on Phone A (child's device):
    Beep alarm for overspeeding and fall detection.
    Real-time location displayed on Phone B (parent's device) using an image of the local map.
    Audible alerts on Phone B for overspeeding and fall detection.
    
Emergency Response:

  In case of a fall:
    Alarm on Phone A with option to disable.
    Real-time location sent to Phone B.
    Automatic activation of microphone on Phone A if alarm isn't disabled within 5 seconds.
    SOS transmission to Phone B with recorded sound via mobile internet.
